## How We Use Information

We may use your email address to communicate with you, for example, to notify you of content that you might find of interest. We use return email addresses to answer the emails we receive.

We will never sell your personal information to any other company.

Finally, we never use or share personally identifiable information provided to us online in ways unrelated to the ones described above without also providing you an opportunity to opt out or otherwise prohibit such unrelated uses.

## A Word On "Cookies"

"Cookies" are small items of data that some websites either write to your hard drive upon your visit to their site(s) or store in the browser. 
These data files contain information the site can use to organize the pages you have visited on a particular website. 
Some of our websites may use "cookie" technology to measure site activity and tailor information to fit your personal interests. 
In this way, we can deliver tailor-made information suiting your personal interests upon your next visit to our site(s). 
Our use of "cookies" technology is, thus, to provide you with a more individualized delivery of information and an optimal viewing experience.

## Google Ads and Remarketing

We use the remarketing feature from Google Ads. 
This feature is used to present website users advertising within the Google ad network. 
A "cookie" is stored in the browser of a user to the website that enables the user to be recognized on Google's network after they leave our site. 
Google can present the user with advertisements that relate to content that they had previously viewed on websites that use the remarketing feature from Google.
According to its own policy, Google does not collect any personal data with this process. 
Nevertheless, if you do not want to use the remarketing feature from Google, you can disable it by changing the appropriate settings at Google Ad Settings.
