      "title": "Q&A Section",
      "question-1": {
        "question": "How Does SlimeVR Work?",
        "answer": "Each SlimeVR Tracker tracks its own absolute rotation using an IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit). It sends the data to SlimeVR Server running on your PC or smartphone via Wi-Fi. The SlimeVR Server combines the data from multiple trackers and your body proportions to calculate the position of your body parts using your headset as a reference point."
      },
      "question-2": {
        "question": "Does SlimeVR Require Base Stations?",
        "answer": "SlimeVR Trackers don't require base stations or other external tracking systems."

      },
      "question-4": {
        "question": "Can SlimeVR Be Occluded?",

      },
      "question-5": {
        "question": "What Is IMU Tracker Drift?",
        "answer": "Due to the nature of IMU trackers they are susceptible to something called yaw drift.\n\n This is not the same as controller stick drift. IMU yaw drift is caused by very minor tracking imperfections that accumulate over time and cause a tracker to think it has rotated further than it actually has.\n\n This takes some time to occur and can be very easily resolved with a reset!"
      },
      "question-6": {
        "question": "How Do I Reset IMU Tracker Drift?",
        "answer": "With SlimeVR, resetting is very simple: just look forward and tap your chest tracker twice. You can configure other ways to reset, like key- or controller bindings, or other taps."
      },
